# Project 3: Turing machine simulator

* Author: Jack Garcia, Josh Miller
* Class: CS361 Section #2
* Semester: Spring 2024

## Overview

This program is a Turing machine simulator designed to interpret and execute a variety of Turing machine configurations.

## Reflection

The lectures provided us with a robust theoretical foundation which was crucial for understanding the operational 
mechanics of Turing machines. Implementing the tape manipulation and transition functions was particularly challenging. 
We encountered issues with the transition logic that resulted in unexpected behavior, but these were resolved after 
several debugging sessions. This project not only tested our problem-solving skills but also deepened our appreciation 
for the complexity of Turing machines.

Our team maintained excellent communication throughout the project, clearly dividing tasks to avoid any overlap and 
ensure coherent integration of different components. As each module was completed, we conducted thorough tests to ensure 
that all parts worked seamlessly together. This project was an engaging and educational extension of our previous 
coursework, highlighting the practical applications of Turing machines in computer science.
